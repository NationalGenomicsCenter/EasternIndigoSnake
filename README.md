# Eastern Indigo Snake Project
This project resulted in two manuscripts; an experimental study looking at the persistence and accumulation of environmental DNA (eDNA) and a field study comparing eDNA to camera traps and visual searches as monitoring methods for the eastern indigo snake. The datasets and scripts are described below.
